/////******** USEFUL HINTS FOR ALL THE 14 OPERATIONS*****************
In binary trees, the main tool to solve all the problems is recursion. In recursion, in many of the cases below, we have a 
set pattern t solve the problem.

In recursion, we have a BASE CASE -> so that the recursion doesn't continue for infinite loop

The second part is the traversal:
for example in the operation where we need to find the size of the tree. We subdivide the problem so that we calculate 
the size of the left subtree and the size of the right subtree. To go to the left and right, we require an efficient and
proper traversal. Here comes the importance of the 3 traversals 1) Inorder 2) Preorder 3) Postorder.
Hence in the size problem, we have the 2nd part as
int leftsubtree = size(node.left);
int rightsubtree = size(node.right);
This for the 2nd part of recursion. If we see the above traversal, we will easly make out that the above traversal made
is a POSTORDER traversal. Hence traversals are very very important part in learning trees. Also there are cases where 
we will use BFS and DFS raversals. The three traversals Inorder, Prorder, Postorder are nothing but variants of DFS traversals.
A BFS is called as a level-order traversal.

The third part is where the proper answer needs to be returned.
for example, in the case of the size of the tree, the last part(aka CONCLUSION part) is as follows:
return (leftsubtree+1+rightsubtree); // plus 1 is for the parent node

Thus, we can say that most of the recursion problems consists of 3 parts:
INTRO (BASE CASE or a terminating condition which is mostly a return statement)
BODY (TRAVERSAL)
CONCLUSION (PROPER RETURN PART which is mostly a return statement)

/* The BEST and the most EFFICIENT program to check whether the given tree is a binary search tree.

The trick is to write a utility helper function isBST(struct node* node, int min, int max) that 
traverses down the tree keeping track of the narrowing min and max allowed values as it goes, looking at 
each node only once. The initial values for min and max should be INT_MIN and INT_MAX — they narrow from there.

The Time and Space complexity of the below program is as follows:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1) if Function Call Stack size is not considered (I think they mean recursion), otherwise O(n)


Also one more method is where we can do a inorder traversal and store the elements in an array. Now we can check if the array is 
sorted, if yes then the tree is a BST otherwise it is not.
In this, the time complexity will be O(n) [Actually O(n+n), one for inorder and the other 
for searching whether the array is sorted -> which is rounded off to O(n)] and the space complexity
will be O(n) which is the space required by the auxilary array for storing the inorder traversal.

To find whether a tree is a binary search tree. Please refer the link mentioned below before you go to the code mentioned below:
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/



The contents of the link are:

A binary search tree (BST) is a node based binary tree data structure which has the following properties.
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

From the above properties it naturally follows that:
• Each node (item in the tree) has a distinct key.

BST



METHOD 1 (Simple but Wrong)
Following is a simple program. For each node, check if left node of it is smaller than the node and right node of it is greater than the node.

int isBST(struct node* node) 
{ 
  if (node == NULL) 
    return 1; 
     
  /* false if left is > than node */
  if (node->left != NULL && node->left->data > node->data) 
    return 0; 
     
  /* false if right is < than node */
  if (node->right != NULL && node->right->data < node->data) 
    return 0; 
   
  /* false if, recursively, the left or right is not a BST */
  if (!isBST(node->left) || !isBST(node->right)) 
    return 0; 
     
  /* passing all that, it's a BST */
  return 1; 
}
This approach is wrong as this will return true for below binary tree (and below tree is not a BST because 4 is in left subtree of 3)

tree_bst






METHOD 2 (Correct but not efficient)
For each node, check if max value in left subtree is smaller than the node and min value in right subtree greater than the node.

/* Returns true if a binary tree is a binary search tree */
int isBST(struct node* node) 
{ 
  if (node == NULL) 
    return(true); 
     
  /* false if the max of the left is > than us */
  if (node->left!=NULL && maxValue(node->left) > node->data) 
    return(false); 
     
  /* false if the min of the right is <= than us */
  if (node->right!=NULL && minValue(node->right) < node->data) 
    return(false); 
   
  /* false if, recursively, the left or right is not a BST */
  if (!isBST(node->left) || !isBST(node->right)) 
    return(false); 
     
  /* passing all that, it's a BST */
  return(true); 
} 
It is assumed that you have helper functions minValue() and maxValue() that return the min or max int value from a non-empty tree



METHOD 3 (Correct and Efficient)
Method 2 above runs slowly since it traverses over some parts of the tree many times. A better solution looks at each node only once. The trick is to write a utility helper function isBSTUtil(struct node* node, int min, int max) that traverses down the tree keeping track of the narrowing min and max allowed values as it goes, looking at each node only once. The initial values for min and max should be INT_MIN and INT_MAX — they narrow from there.

/* Returns true if the given tree is a binary search tree 
 (efficient version). */ 
int isBST(struct node* node) 
{ 
  return(isBSTUtil(node, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)); 
} 

/* Returns true if the given tree is a BST and its 
 values are >= min and <= max. */

int isBSTUtil(struct node* node, int min, int max);
 
/* Returns true if the given tree is a binary search tree

int isBST(struct node* node) 
{ 
  return(isBSTUtil(node, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)); 
} 
 
/* Returns true if the given tree is a BST and its 
   values are >= min and <= max. */
int isBSTUtil(struct node* node, int min, int max) 
{ 
 
  /* an empty tree is BST */

     return 1;
       
  /* false if this node violates the min/max constraint */ 
  if (node->data < min || node->data > max) 
     return 0; 
 
  /* otherwise check the subtrees recursively, 
   tightening the min or max constraint */
  return
    isBSTUtil(node->left, min, node->data-1) &&  // Allow only distinct values
    isBSTUtil(node->right, node->data+1, max);  // Allow only distinct values
} 
 
/* Helper function that allocates a new node with the
   given data and NULL left and right pointers. */
struct node* newNode(int data)
{
  struct node* node = (struct node*)
                       malloc(sizeof(struct node));
  node->data = data;
  node->left = NULL;
  node->right = NULL;
 
  return(node);
}
 
/* Driver program to test above functions*/
int main()
{
  struct node *root = newNode(4);

  root->right       = newNode(5);
  root->left->left  = newNode(1);
  root->left->right = newNode(3); 
 
  if(isBST(root))
    printf("Is BST");
  else
    printf("Not a BST");
     
  getchar();
  return 0;
}  
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1) if Function Call Stack size is not considered, otherwise O(n)

METHOD 4(Using In-Order Traversal)
Thanks to LJW489 for suggesting this method.
1) Do In-Order Traversal of the given tree and store the result in a temp array.
3) Check if the temp array is sorted in ascending order, if it is, then the tree is BST.

Time Complexity: O(n)

We can avoid the use of Auxiliary Array. While doing In-Order traversal, we can keep track of previously visited node. If the value of the currently visited node is less than the previous value, then tree is not BST. Thanks to ygos for this space optimization.

bool isBST(struct node* root)
{
    static struct node *prev = NULL;
     
    // traverse the tree in inorder fashion and keep track of prev node
    if (root)
    {
        if (!isBST(root->left))
          return false;
 
        // Allows only distinct valued nodes 
        if (prev != NULL && root->data <= prev->data)
          return false;
 
        prev = root;
 
        return isBST(root->right);
    }
 
    return true;
}
The use of static variable can also be avoided by using reference to prev node as a parameter (Similar to this post).
